## Description

The sidequest prompt was to create an interactive game branching like a decision tree. This is a potion game where the player must find the cure by picking the correct base ingredient and add-on ingredient to get the good ending. There are multiple endings based on combinations the user picks and calls multiple screens. Users can then return to the start and try other endings.
